-   Experience Matters: A tool can only valuable if you adopt it naturally - so we intentionally design user experiences that are easy and enjoyable to use.

Chat history is optionally stored in your own vault. API keys are stored in plugin settings on your device. In accordance with Obsidian's policy, there is zero client-side telemetry and we do not collect any user data.
